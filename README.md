The following posts were written for a company using AI to help the trucking industry with driver scheduling, route optimization, and more.

People are reluctant to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) when they're worried about it taking their jobs. In this post, I explained a tech company's offerings through the lens of augmented intelligence, which seems to improve human workers rather than replace them.</p></li>

The COVID-19 pandemic forced nearly every business to become more flexible as the world adapted to remote work. In this post, I explained why dispatching trucks from home was still a great choice even in a post-pandemic world.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://optym.com/blog/trucking-document-management" rel="noopener norefferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trucking document management doesn’t have to be hard</a><br>
Document management is usually way down the list of things people associate with truck driving. In this post, I explained how the company's digital document solution could make truck driver's easier.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.sagiss.com/blog/why-microsoft-edge-is-the-best-web-browser-for-business" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Why Microsoft Edge is the best web browser for business</a><br>
So many people think Microsoft Edge is just a renamed Internet Explorer. But Edge, built on the same framework as Google's Chrome, includes many improvements that make it the best browser for those who want to get real work done.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.sagiss.com/blog/what-is-the-cost-of-a-data-breach" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">What is the cost of a data breach?</a><br>
The cost of a data breach goes well beyond just paying the ransom.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://www.sagiss.com/blog/why-your-company-needs-end-user-security-training" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Why your company needs end user security training</a><br>
If you have the latest and greatest cybersecurity tools, then you don't need end user security training, right? WRONG! Educating your employees is still the best tool at your company's disposal.</p></li>
